# elasticsearch-queries

This repo is a personal collection of Elasticsearch resources, which is for my personal use, e.g. to store some useful Elasticsearch queries for future reference.


## Repository structure

All files are Markdown files that collect resources to achieve certain things. The documents have been written by myself, their contents have either been created by me or partially collected from other places, e.g. Stackoverflow.
